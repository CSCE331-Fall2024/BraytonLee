            <p>
                Throughout my career, I have built several successful systems that have greatly improved
                work
                productivity, reduced overhead costs, and improved safety.

            </p>

            <p>
                My first major project involved designing and implementing a frictionless process for
                machinists
                to track their production, enabling management to identify areas of improvement in several
                key
                areas.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2014, my wife and I moved to Colorado, where I worked at Colorado State University. While
                there I led and worked on two major projects. First, I designed and automated a
                time-tracking
                process for employees that reducing the required effort to produce, inspect, and log entries
                by
                more than 95%.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also developed a database and process for tracking inventory and capital assets that was
                both
                user-friendly and easy to maintain.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most recently, I modeled and prototyped a mesh network of air monitoring sensors that can be
                used by a fire department HAZMAT team. The system consists of small edge sensors that are to
                be
                distributed within hot and cold zones to monitor changing conditions without risking first
                responders during an emergency response.

            <p>In the near future, I am working towards two major goals. First, I will build a machine
                vision
                and machine learning system to supplement health and environmental monitoring for animals
                housed
                in fixed facilities, for example animals in shelters, hospitals, and research. The purpose
                of
                this system is to provide a second line of defense in identifying illness or abnormal
                conditions
                in a constantly monitored system, and to assist every hard working and well-meaning care
                giver
                with minimal cost
            </p>
            <p>

                Additionally, it is also my most heartfelt desire to work with others in advancing the cause
                of
                science and spaceflight by working with NASA or another space-focused organization. Most
                people
                think of “space exploration” as simply looking up; however, nearly every discovery and
                invention
                from space research and engineering has the potential to directly impact live on Earth,
                making
                it a better and safer for everyone.
