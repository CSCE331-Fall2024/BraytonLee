                In addition to the standard projects that accompanied my degree, I have
                built several successful systems throughout my career that have greatly enhance productivity, reduced
                overhead costs, and improved safety.

            </p>

            <p>
                My first major project involved designing and implementing a frictionless process for
                machinists
                to track production, enabling management to identify areas of improvement in several
                key
                areas.
            </p>

            <p>
                In 2014, my wife and I moved to Colorado, where I worked at Colorado State University. There I led two
                major projects. First, I designed and automated a
                time-tracking
                process for employees, reducing the required effort to produce, inspect, and log entries
                by
                more than 95%.

                I also developed a user-friendly, easy-to-maintain database and process for tracking inventory and
                capital assets.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most recently, I modeled and prototyped a low-cost mesh network of air-monitoring sensors for
                first-responder
                HAZMAT teams. The system deploys small edge sensors in hot and cold zones to monitor conditions without
                risking first responders during emergencies.

            <p>In the near future, I am working towards two major goals. First, I will build a machine
                vision
                and machine learning system to supplement health and environmental monitoring for animals
                housed
                in fixed facilities, for example animals in shelters, hospitals, and research. The purpose
                of
                this system is to provide a second line of defense in identifying illness or abnormal
                conditions
                in a constantly monitored system, and to assist every hard working and well-meaning care
                giver
                with minimal cost
            </p>
            <p>

                Additionally, it is also my most heartfelt desire to work with others in advancing the cause
                of
                science and spaceflight by working with NASA or another space-focused organization. Most
                people
                think of “space exploration” as simply looking up; however, nearly every discovery and
                invention
                from space research and engineering has the potential to directly impact live on Earth,
                making
                it a better and safer for everyone.
