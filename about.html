            <h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="mainBodyText">

            <p>I live with my wife and our small menagerie of pets, and we both serve as volunteer
                firefighters in our community. In my free time, I enjoy two contrasting sports:
                powerlifting
                and ultra-endurance cycling. My current long-term goal is to complete two different
                cycling
                events: Paris-Brest-Paris and London-Edinburgh-London. Both are rides of about 750 miles
                that must be completed in less than 90 hours. My wife and I have also been playing
                TTRPGs
                with a small group of close friends since 2015.
            </p>
            <p> Academically, I have a diverse set of interests; however, my primary interest is in
                using
                automation to make our lives safer. Humans can make amazing leaps in reasoning to
                achieve
                discoveries. We also quickly become task -saturated, confused, or just plain bored,
                leading
                to mistakes. Machine tools and intelligence can supplement our abilities preventing
                errors,
                or to see through noise to find patterns in tremendous amounts of data.
            </p>
            <p> As technology continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, we have an opportunity to
                prevent accidents, discover illnesses, and intervene to prevent harms that happen daily.
                The
                responsible and ethical creation of these technologies are core values that I hold.
            </p>
            <p> With responsible technology creation and use comes the need for strong security behind
                those
                systems. I am fascinated by cybersecurity, especially the social engineering aspect of
                it.
                Technical exploits are flashy and grab headlines, yet, for the average person, social
                exploitation is by far the biggest threat. When interacting with the public as a
                firefighter, I am amazed at how open and honest people can be and how much information
                people are openly willing to give to strangers. I have learned that education is
                paramount
                for everyone involved with technology in any way. From national security to the most
                vulnerable, appropriate systems must be in place to seamlessly provide peace of mind and
                the
                ability to fully and ethically implement these systems into our lives.
