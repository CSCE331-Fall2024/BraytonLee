                        <p>I live with my wife and our small menagerie of pets, and we both serve as volunteer
                            firefighters in our community. In my free time, I enjoy two contrasting sports: powerlifting
                            and ultra-endurance cycling. My current long-term goal is to complete two different cycling
                            events: Paris-Brest-Paris and London-Edinburgh-London. Both are rides of about 750 miles
                            that must be completed in less than 90 hours. My wife and I have also been playing TTRPGs
                            with a small group of close friends since 2015.
                        </p>
                        <p> Academically, I have a diverse set of interests; however, my primary interest is in using
                            automation to make our lives safer. Humans can make amazing leaps in reasoning to achieve
                            discoveries. We also quickly become task -saturated, confused, or just plain bored, leading
                            to mistakes. Machine tools and intelligence can supplement our abilities preventing errors,
                            or to see through noise to find patterns in tremendous amounts of data.
                        </p>
                        <p> As technology continues to permeate every aspect of our lives, we have an opportunity to
                            prevent accidents, discover illnesses, and intervene to prevent harms that happen daily. The
                            responsible and ethical creation of these technologies are core values that I hold.
                        </p>
                        <p> With responsible technology creation and use comes the need for strong security behind those
                            systems. I am fascinated by cybersecurity, especially the social engineering aspect of it.
                            Technical exploits are flashy and grab headlines, yet, for the average person, social
                            exploitation is by far the biggest threat. When interacting with the public as a
                            firefighter, I am amazed at how open and honest people can be and how much information
                            people are openly willing to give to strangers. I have learned that education is paramount
                            for everyone involved with technology in any way. From national security to the most
                            vulnerable, appropriate systems must be in place to seamlessly provide peace of mind and the
                            ability to fully and ethically implement these systems into our lives.
